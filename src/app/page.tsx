      <h3>About Me</h3>

      <p>
        Hi, I&apos;m <strong>Tofara</strong> — a software engineer and AI systems builder from <strong>Harare, Zimbabwe</strong>, based between <strong>Dubai and Abu Dhabi</strong>. I&apos;m passionate about the intersection of <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>, <strong>full-stack development</strong>, and <strong>infrastructure engineering</strong> — building production-grade systems that scale, adapt, and solve real-world problems.
      </p>

      <p>
        I&apos;m passionate about transforming ideas into reliable, intelligent systems. I&apos;ve worked across the full stack — from designing APIs and scalable architectures to developing <strong>agentic AI workflows</strong> that automate complex reasoning tasks. My work combines <strong>deep technical problem-solving</strong> with <strong>product intuition</strong> — every line of code is written with performance, maintainability, and real-world impact in mind.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Do</h3>

      <p>
        I currently work as a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> at a US-based AI startup, building production-grade agentic systems and LLM-powered microservices. My work spans the full AI engineering stack:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Using Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot</strong> to build features with AI-first development practices — accelerating implementation through AI pair programming, exploring architectural patterns with LLM reasoning, and transforming requirements into production-ready code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Architecting agentic AI systems</strong> with LangGraph, CrewAI, and custom agent frameworks — designing multi-agent workflows for autonomous reasoning, tool orchestration, and state management across distributed systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Building Python microservices and REST APIs</strong> with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis — implementing TDD, asynchronous processing, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations for LLM-native applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Developing production frontends</strong> using TypeScript, Next.js, and React — building real-time AI dashboards, streaming LLM responses, and interactive agent interfaces with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Implementing observability and infrastructure</strong> with Prometheus, Grafana, Traefik, and Docker — deploying containerized services with CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions and monitoring production LLM systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Collaborating across engineering and product</strong> to translate AI research into scalable systems, working directly with founders to architect technical solutions aligned with product vision.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        My approach is <strong>full-stack and holistic</strong> — I care about every layer, from the database schema to the user experience, and the intelligence that connects them.
      </p>

      <h3>Technical Expertise</h3>

      <p>
        I&apos;m fluent in multiple layers of modern engineering:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Languages:</strong> Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, C, C++, SQL
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>AI Dev Tools:</strong> Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Model Context Protocol (MCP), and prompt engineering
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Frameworks:</strong> FastAPI, Django, Next.js, React, LangChain, CrewAI
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Docker, GitHub Actions, CI/CD, Prisma, PostgreSQL
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>AI Systems:</strong> RAG pipelines, agentic workflows, API-based LLM orchestration, and prompt engineering
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Software Principles:</strong> SOLID, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Test-Driven Development (TDD), and Clean Architecture
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        My foundation was built on <strong>two years of intensive C/C++ programming</strong>, where I developed HTTP servers, game engines, and multithreaded applications. This low-level grounding taught me how computers truly work — memory, processes, networking — and gave me the technical confidence to design complex, distributed systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        I later transitioned to full-stack web and AI development, where I now blend modern web frameworks with machine intelligence, creating systems that <em>learn</em>, <em>adapt</em>, and <em>scale</em>.
      </p>

      <h3>Work & Collaboration</h3>

      <p>
        Beyond the technical layer, I bring <strong>strong communication and teamwork</strong>. I&apos;ve worked in remote, multicultural teams spanning the US, UAE, and Africa — coordinating across time zones, aligning business priorities with technical execution, and delivering consistently.
      </p>

      <p>
        I&apos;m comfortable working directly with <strong>non-technical founders, PMs, and clients</strong>, translating high-level product ideas into concrete technical solutions. I also enjoy mentoring peers, reviewing code, and improving developer workflows through automation and DevOps practices.
      </p>

      <p>
        My professional values are: <strong>clarity, reliability, and precision</strong> — whether in communication or code.
      </p>

      <h3>Education</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>École 42 Abu Dhabi</strong> (Software Engineering Program)
          <br />
          Intensive peer-driven program focused on low-level programming, system design, and large-scale software projects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cambridge International A Levels:</strong> 1A*, 2A&apos;s, 1B (Mathematics and Physical Sciences)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>IGCSE:</strong> 8A*&apos;s and 1A
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>SAT Math:</strong> 770 / 800
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These experiences trained me to think algorithmically, debug deeply, and approach problems with both creativity and rigor.
      </p>

      <h3>Ventures & Side Projects</h3>

      <p>
        Outside work, I&apos;m building:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>claireAI</strong> — a WhatsApp-based AI assistant designed as a virtual employee for small businesses, automating communication, scheduling, and lead management through conversational AI.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Horizon</strong> — a software studio focused on developing high-quality web infrastructure and AI integrations across Southern Africa.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Vision & Craft</h3>

      <p>
        I believe the best software blends <strong>engineering precision</strong> with <strong>creative design</strong>. My long-term goal is to create systems that serve millions of users, combining robust infrastructure with human-centered AI capabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        I&apos;m especially interested in how <strong>LLMs, agentic systems, and retrieval architectures</strong> can power the next generation of educational and productivity tools — systems that understand and adapt to human intent, not just execute commands.
      </p>
