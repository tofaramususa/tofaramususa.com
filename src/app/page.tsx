      </p>
      <p>
        Deep understanding of CS principles. I programmed in C/C++ for 2 years.
        Built games, HTTP servers, multi-threaded apps etc. That set the
        foundation for my technical skills, to be able to understand complex
        systems and build robust software. I have used JavaScript, TypeScript,
        Python to ship production code. I have used Docker, GitHub Actions,
        CI/CD to deploy software.{" "}
        <strong>
          My expertise lies in learning and in managing deep complexity
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am able to communicate effectively, working with non-technical CEOs to
        translate user stories into code. I worked in remote technical teams
        with diverse nationalities. I am passionate about startups as well.
        Working in one and building my own.
