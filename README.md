# Tofara Mususa's Personal Website

## About the Project

Personal website showcases my bio, work experience, education, and technical skills.

- **TypeScript**: The website is built using TypeScript, which adds static type definitions to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and understandability.
- **Next.js**: This React framework provides server-side rendering and generates static websites, ensuring fast load times and a seamless user experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the website, allowing for rapid UI development with a focus on design consistency.
- **shadcn/ui**: Presumably a UI component library or a set of custom utilities (not publicly known), used to build the user interface.
- **Vercel**: The hosting platform where the website is deployed, offering great performance and ease of use for Next.js applications.
- **Google Fonts (QuickSand)**: The QuickSand font from Google Fonts is used to enhance the website's typography and overall aesthetic.

## Project Structure

The website's main entry point is the `Home` function component, which renders the content and structure of the homepage.
